# java-sound-libraries
The above libraries have originally been developed from [JavaZoom](http://www.javazoom.net) . Though they have stopped being devbeloped long time ago.

### Can i combine the capabilities of all them in one ?
Soore here is another repository which does exactly that [java-stream-player](https://github.com/goxr3plus/java-stream-player) providing you the ability to create a full Advanced Media Player like [XR3Player](https://github.com/goxr3plus/XR3Player)

### The goal
All this libraries will be updated using Java 8 ++ and soon Java 9++ .

### Why ?
Because i am using them in many projects like -> [XR3Player](https://github.com/goxr3plus/XR3Player)

### Some more information
