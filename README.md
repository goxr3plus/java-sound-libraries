# java-sound-libraries
The above libraries have originally been developed from JavaZoom . Though they have stopped being devbeloped long time ago.

### Can i combine the capabilities of all them in one ?
Soore here is another repository which does exactly that [java-stream-player](https://github.com/goxr3plus/java-stream-player) providing you the ability to create a full Advanced Media Player like [XR3Player](https://github.com/goxr3plus/XR3Player)

### The goal
All this libraries will be updated using Java 8 ++ and soon Java 9++ .

### Why ?
Because i am using them in many projects like -> [XR3Player](https://github.com/goxr3plus/XR3Player)

### Some more information

  * http://www.javazoom.net/jlgui/api.html[BasicPlayer] - BasicPlayer layer is the simple player API of jlGui. These classes are designed to be used in any application that needs simple features (play, stop, pause, resume, seek) to play audio file or stream. It's a high-level API over JavaSound API.
