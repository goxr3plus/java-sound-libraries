Always following the license of course :)

The JLayer project has been launched on February 1999. The goal is to provide a Java™ - real time - MP3 decoder library. JLayerME sub-project has been launched on April 2002, it's the J2ME-oriented version of JLayer.

Both JLayer and JLayerME are licensed under LGPL.

MP3SPI is a Java plugin, based on JLayer, that adds MP3 support to the Java platform. jlGui is a graphical music player (WinAmp clone). It focuses on the sound capabilities of Java and it relies on MP3SPI for MP3 support.

The JLayer project is volunteer-driven. We don't have any specific requirement for volunteers other than willingness to really contribute while following the projects goal. Anyone wanting to join the development effort should send an email to jlayer@javazoom.net where all development efforts are coordinated.
