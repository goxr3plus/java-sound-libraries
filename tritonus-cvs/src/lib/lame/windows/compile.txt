   javah org.tritonus.lowlevel.lame.Lame .
2. Copy org_tritonus_lowlevel_lame_Lame.c from one directory higher
   to this directory.
2.1 For Borland free C++ command line tools:
    (download from http://www.borland.com/bcppbuilder/freecompiler/cppc55steps.html)
    Edit the provided the makefile to match your settings. 
    Run it with "make" (Borland make)
2.2 For MS VC++ 6.0:
    Open a workspace with bladenc.c, bladenc.h, 
    org_tritonus_lowlevel_lame_Lame.h, org_tritonus_lowlevel_lame_Lame.c.
    ( old project/workspace files are included)
    Go to project settings, select "All configurations", click on the 
    C/C++ tab and selct as category "Preprocessor". In "Additional 
    include directories" set the path of the "include" and 
    "include\win32" directories of your JDK1.3 installation.
    Set the symbol "USE_BLADENC_API".
    You can set the symbol _BLADEDLL when you want to link statically.

\JDK1.3\jre\bin\ext (for the JDK 1.3)
\Program Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.3.0_02\lib\ext (for JRE 1.3.0_02 - also for Java plugin)

When your IE or NS supports Java 2 Version 1.3 or higher directly,
you may need to install it in
\WINNT\java\trustlib (for Internet Explorer)
\Program Files\Netscape\Communicator\java\classes (for Netscape 4.6).

You need tritonus_mp3.jar and tritonus_share.jar to make the encoder work.
You can use "Mp3Encoder.java" from the Java Sound Examples to test it.
