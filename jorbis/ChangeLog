	   applet to play given stream at the start-up time.

Changes since version 0.0.14:
- bugfix: case-insensitive matching in Comment was broken.
- bugfix: query for the tag "ART" would match the tag "ARTIST".
Many thanks to Gregorio Roper at gmx dot li, who pointed out above problem.

	
Changes since version 0.0.13:
- added com.jcraft.jogg.Buffer.readB method for Fluendo's theora decoder.
- added com.jcraft.jogg.Page.copy method for handling grouped ogg streams.

	
Changes since version 0.0.12:
- fixed resorce leaks in com.jcraft.jorbis.VorbisFile class.
	
	
Changes since version 0.0.11:
- updated VorbisFile class for calculating total length in seconds of a
  Vorbis file.
- some improvements on JOrbisPlayer. For example, songs on play-list will
  be played sequentially.	

	
Changes since version 0.0.10:
- fixed bugs and incompleteness in the 'residue back-end type 2',
  which is required for decoding stereo coupling streams generated
  by RC3 encoder.
- fixed minor bugs in JOrbisPlayer.

	
Changes since version 0.0.9:
- modified JOrbisPlayer for playing Ogg Vorbis live streams on UDP broadcast
  packets from JRoar 0.0.2.
	

Changes since version 0.0.8:
- improved the performance. In this improvement, the frequency of
  GC invocations has been suppressed by refraining from object
  allocations.
- modified JOrbisPlayer for accepting *.m3u file.
	
Changes since version 0.0.7:
- added a 'simple' comment editor in pure Java.
  It has been located at 'comment_editor' directory.	
- improved for decoding Ogg Vorbis streams generated by 1.0 RC2 encoder.
- modified JOrbisPlayer for accepting *.pls file.
	
Changes since version 0.0.6:
- fixed bugs in playing the chained ogg bit stream.

	
Changes since version 0.0.5:
- added the support for odd-sized LSP filters. 
  Now, JOribPlayer can correctly decode/play low bitrate ogg bit streams,
  which are encoded by Vorbis 1.0beta4.
  Many thanks to smoerk, who reported me a glitch in playing
  low bitrate ogg bit streams on previous releases.
- tuned up the performance a little bit.

	
Changes since version 0.0.4:
- fixed a bug in the LSP conversion routines.
  Now, JOribPlayer can decode/play 24khz/mono ogg bit streams.
- fixed a bug in handling comments.

	
Changes since version 0.0.3:
- modified to use the data type 'float' instead of 'double' for handling 
  internal data.	 
- added the LSP conversion routines.
- moved chunk of code for handling the ogg bit stream to
  the 'com.jcraft.jogg' package.

	
Changes since version 0.0.2:
- added a pure Java Ogg Vorbis player.


Changes since version 0.0.1:
- fixed bugs in the synthesis engine.
  By this bug fix, the sound quality of output from JOrbis has 
  been improved.
